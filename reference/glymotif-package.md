# glymotif: Extract glycan motifs from glycan structures

Provides comprehensive tools for glycan motif analysis and detection in
glycobioinformatics research. The package enables users to identify,
count, and match glycan motifs (recurring substructures) within complex
glycan structures using advanced subgraph isomorphism algorithms. It
includes a curated database of known motifs from the GlycoMotif GlyGen
Collection, supports both concrete and generic monosaccharide matching,
and offers flexible alignment options (core, terminal, or anywhere). Key
functionalities include motif presence detection, occurrence counting,
detailed node-to-node mapping, and batch analysis of multiple glycans
against multiple motifs. The package seamlessly integrates with the
glycoverse ecosystem, particularly 'glyrepr' and 'glyparse', making it
essential for structural glycomics analysis, biomarker discovery, and
understanding glycan-mediated biological processes.
