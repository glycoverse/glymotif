## What is a Glycan Motif? üß¨

Imagine you're looking at a complex glycan structure‚Äîthose intricate branched molecules that decorate your cells.
Hidden within these molecular architectures are recurring patterns called "motifs."
Think of them as the molecular equivalent of architectural motifs: 
recognizable design elements that appear across different buildings (or in this case, 
different glycans).

A glycan motif is simply a substructure that appears in multiple glycans.
(Don't confuse this with protein motifs‚Äîwe're talking about carbohydrates here! üç≠)
Some famous examples include the N-glycan core, 
Lewis X antigen, 
and the Tn antigen.

## Why Should You Care? ü§î

Here's where it gets exciting: 
these motifs aren't just decorative‚Äîthey're functional.
They determine how cells interact, 
how pathogens bind, 
and how your immune system recognizes friend from foe.

This package, 
`glymotif`, 
is your computational microscope üî¨ for advanced glycan motif analysis.
It helps you answer two fundamental questions:

- **Does this glycan contain a specific motif?**
- **How many times does this motif appear?**

The best part? ‚ú®
Everything works with vectors of glycans, 
so you can analyze hundreds or thousands at once.

**Important note:** This package builds on the powerful [glyrepr](https://github.com/glycoverse/glyrepr) package.
If you haven't used it before, 
we highly recommend checking out its [introduction](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyrepr/articles/glyrepr.html) first.

```{r setup}
library(glymotif)
```

## A Quick Challenge üß©

Let's start with a visual puzzle.
Can you tell if the glycan on the left contains the motif on the right?

![](img/intro_example.png)

If you said "yes," 
congratulations‚Äîyou have a keen eye! üëÄ
But what if I gave you 500 glycans and 20 motifs to check?
That's where `glymotif` becomes indispensable.

Let's see it in action using IUPAC-condensed notation 
(the standard text format for glycans in the `glycoverse` ecosystem).
If this notation looks unfamiliar, 
don't worry‚Äîcheck out [this helpful guide](https://glycoverse.github.io/glyrepr/articles/iupac.html) first.

```{r}
glycans <- c(
  "Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)[Fuc(a1-3)]GlcNAc(b1-3)Gal(b1-3)GalNAc",
  "Neu5Ac(a2-?)Gal(b1-3)[Fuc(a1-3)]GlcNAc",
  "Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)[Fuc(a1-6)]GlcNAc",
  "Gal(b1-3)GalNAc",
  "Neu5Ac9Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc"
)
motif <- "Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)[Fuc(a1-3)]GlcNAc"
have_motif(glycans, motif)
```

Pretty neat, 
right? üòé

## Your Toolkit: Four Essential Functions üõ†Ô∏è

`glymotif` provides four core functions that work together like a well-designed instrument panel:

- **`have_motif()`**: Returns TRUE/FALSE for each glycan‚Äîdoes it contain the motif?
- **`count_motif()`**: Returns numbers‚Äîhow many times does the motif appear?
- **`have_motifs()`**: The plural version‚Äîchecks multiple motifs at once, 
returns a matrix
- **`count_motifs()`**: Counts multiple motifs simultaneously, 
returns a matrix

### Why the Plural Functions? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

You might wonder: 
"Why not just use `have_motif()` in a loop?"
Great question! üí≠
There are two compelling reasons:

**1. Predictable output format** üìä
Just like the `purrr` package has different `map` functions for different return types, 
our functions guarantee consistent outputs.
The singular functions return vectors; 
the plural functions return matrices.
No surprises, 
no wrestling with data types.

**2. Optimized performance** ‚ö°
The plural functions are specifically optimized for multiple motifs.
They're significantly faster than looping or using `purrr::map()` because they avoid redundant computations.

### Seeing Them in Action

Let's define some motifs to work with:

```{r}
motifs <- c(
  "Neu5Ac(a2-3)Gal(b1-3)[Fuc(a1-3)]GlcNAc",
  "Fuc(a1-",
  "Gal(b1-3)GalNAc"
)
```

All functions follow the same pattern:

- **First argument:** your glycans (as IUPAC strings or a `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` object)
- **Second argument:** your motif(s) (IUPAC strings, 
a `glyrepr::glycan_structure()` object, 
or predefined motif names)

```{r}
have_motif(glycans, motif)
```

```{r}
unname(have_motifs(glycans, motifs))  # Removing names for cleaner display
```

**Pro tip:** üí° You don't need to memorize complex IUPAC strings!
Use predefined motif names instead:

```{r}
available_motifs()[1:10]
```

```{r}
have_motif(glycans, "Type 2 LN2")
```

## The Art and Science of Motif Matching üé®üî¨

Now we enter the fascinating complexity of motif recognition.
You might think: 
"It's just pattern matching, 
right?"
Well, 
not quite. ü§®

Real-world glycan data is beautifully messy:

- **Missing linkage information**: Sometimes we only know "there's a link" but not its exact type
- **Generic monosaccharides**: Mass spectrometry might only tell us "Hex" instead of "Glucose"
- **Chemical modifications**: Sulfation, 
acetylation, 
and other decorations add complexity
- **Positional constraints**: Some motifs only "count" when they appear in specific locations

Consider the Tn antigen‚Äîit's just a single GalNAc residue.
But it shouldn't match every GalNAc in a complex N-glycan, 
should it?
Context matters.

Similarly, 
an O-glycan core motif should only be recognized at the reducing end, 
not buried in the middle of a structure.

`glymotif` handles all these complexities through its sophisticated matching engine.
The algorithm considers structural context, 
chemical modifications, 
and biological relevance to make intelligent matching decisions.

For the full technical details, 
dive into the documentation for `have_motif()`‚Äîit's quite a journey!

## A Special Focus: N-Glycan Analysis üéØ

If you work with N-linked glycans (N-glycans), 
you're in for a treat! üéâ
These are the most extensively studied and well-characterized glycans in biology, 
and `glymotif` has specialized tools just for them.

### Why N-Glycans Deserve Special Attention

N-glycans are remarkable for their structural predictability.
Unlike their wild cousins (O-glycans and others), 
N-glycans follow strict biosynthetic rules.
This constraint creates opportunities: 
we can describe N-glycan architecture using a standardized vocabulary that glycobiologists have developed over decades.

Think of it like describing houses in a planned community‚Äîwhile each house is unique, 
they all follow the same architectural principles.
You can meaningfully ask: 
"How many bedrooms?" 
"Does it have a garage?" 
"What style is the roof?"

For N-glycans, 
the equivalent questions are:

- **What type is it?** (high mannose, hybrid, complex, or paucimannose)
- **How many antenna branches?**
- **Does it have a bisecting GlcNAc?**
- **How many core fucoses?**
- **How many arm fucoses?**
- **How many terminal galactoses?**

### Your N-Glycan Analysis Toolkit

`glymotif` provides a comprehensive suite of functions for N-glycan characterization:

**Classification and Structure:**

- `is_n_glycan()`: Confirms whether your structure is actually an N-glycan
- `n_glycan_type()`: Classifies as high mannose, 
hybrid, 
complex, 
or paucimannose

**Branching Architecture:**

- `n_antennae()`: Counts the number of antenna branches
- `has_bisecting()`: Detects bisecting GlcNAc presence

**Fucosylation Patterns:**

- `n_core_fuc()`: Counts core fucoses (attached to the reducing-end GlcNAc)
- `n_arm_fuc()`: Counts arm fucoses (attached to antenna GlcNAcs)

**Terminal Features:**

- `n_gal()`: Counts total galactose residues
- `n_terminal_gal()`: Counts terminal galactoses (those without sialic acid caps)

### The Swiss Army Knife: `describe_n_glycans()` üîß

Rather than calling each function individually, 
you can use `describe_n_glycans()` to get a complete structural profile in one go.
It's like having a comprehensive building inspection that checks everything at once:

```{r}
n_glycans <- c(
  "Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-3)Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc",
  "GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-3)[Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)[Fuc(a1-6)]GlcNAc",
  "Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-3)[Gal(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-2)Man(a1-6)]Man(b1-4)GlcNAc(b1-4)GlcNAc"
)
describe_n_glycans(n_glycans)
```

### Embracing the Messy Reality: Working with Ambiguous Data üå™Ô∏è

Here's where `glymotif` truly shines‚Äîit thrives on incomplete information! ‚ú®
In the real world of glycomics or glycoproteomics research, 
you rarely get perfect structural data.
Mass spectrometry might only tell you "there's a hexose here" without specifying 
whether it's glucose, galactose, or mannose.
Linkage information might be completely missing or uncertain.

**The beauty of N-glycan analysis?** üíé
The strict biosynthetic rules act as a Rosetta Stone, 
allowing us to decode meaning from ambiguous data.

Our functions are designed to work with minimal information requirements:

- **Generic monosaccharides**: "Hex", "HexNAc", "dHex", instead of specific sugars
- **Missing linkages**: Those mysterious "??" annotations won't stop the analysis
- **Uncertain positions**: The algorithm makes intelligent assumptions based on N-glycan biology

Let's see this in action with some intentionally ambiguous structures:

```{r}
# These are the same N-glycans as before, but with all specificity stripped away
ambiguous_glycans <- c(
  "Hex(??-?)[Hex(??-?)Hex(??-?)]Hex(??-?)HexNAc(??-?)HexNAc",
  "HexNAc(??-?)Hex(??-?)[Hex(??-?)]Hex(??-?)HexNAc(??-?)[dHex(??-?)]HexNAc",
  "Hex(??-?)HexNAc(??-?)Hex(??-?)[Hex(??-?)HexNAc(??-?)Hex(??-?)]Hex(??-?)HexNAc(??-?)HexNAc"
)
describe_n_glycans(ambiguous_glycans)
```

**Remarkable, isn't it?** ü§Ø
Despite the uncertainty in the input data, 
we get the same structural insights as before.

This tolerance for ambiguity is a game-changer for high-throughput glycomics and glycoproteomics. üöÄ
Whether you're analyzing thousands of glycopeptides from a proteomics experiment or working with automated glycan assignment from mass spectra, 
`glymotif` meets your data where it is‚Äînot where you wish it were.

### Playing Well with Others: Package Integration ü§ù

The real power of `glymotif` shines when it works alongside other tools in the `glycoverse` ecosystem.
If you're already using `glyread` to import your glycoproteomics results and `glyexp` to manage your experimental data, you're in luck! 

There's a seamless integration waiting for you: 
the `glyexp::add_glycan_description()` function can automatically apply all the N-glycan analysis we just discussed to your entire dataset.
No manual loops, 
no data wrangling headaches‚Äîjust one function call to enrich your glycan annotations with comprehensive structural descriptions.

Here's how it works in practice:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(glyread)
library(glyexp)

# Read your glycoproteomics results
exp <- read_pglyco3_pglycoquant("results.list")

# Add N-glycan structural descriptions automatically
exp <- add_glycan_description(exp)

# Now your experiment object contains rich glycan annotations!
```

**What happens behind the scenes?** üé≠
The function identifies N-glycan structures in your data, 
runs `describe_n_glycans()` on them, 
and seamlessly integrates the results into your experiment's variable information table.
It's like having a personal glycan analyst working 24/7!
