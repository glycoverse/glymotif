Description: 
    Provides comprehensive tools for glycan motif analysis and detection in 
    glycobioinformatics research. The package enables users to identify, count, 
    and match glycan motifs (recurring substructures) within complex glycan 
    structures using advanced subgraph isomorphism algorithms. It includes a 
    curated database of known motifs from the GlycoMotif GlyGen Collection, 
    supports both concrete and generic monosaccharide matching, and offers 
    flexible alignment options (core, terminal, or anywhere). Key functionalities 
    include motif presence detection, occurrence counting, detailed node-to-node 
    mapping, and batch analysis of multiple glycans against multiple motifs. 
    The package seamlessly integrates with the glycoverse ecosystem, particularly 
    'glyrepr' and 'glyparse', making it essential for structural glycomics 
    analysis, biomarker discovery, and understanding glycan-mediated biological 
    processes.
